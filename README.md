# VortexMethodDMV

This code was made by students from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Pau Ondoño, Miquel Tomàs, Pol Miguel, Pau Andrés and Biel Pujadas.
The main objective of the project is to be able to use the TAT theory and the vortex circultaion method (DMV) to calcule the parameters 
of a 4-digit NACA airfoil with and without flap.

STATUS OF THE PROJECT: in development
